# Adaptive Speech 
A Mobile Application using Flutter to help in communication between especially able (deaf) and others.
  
## About  
Our goal is to make it easier for individuals who are deaf or have hearing loss to communicate with the people around them: relatives, friends, acquaintances, and strangers, through:

- Converting speech to text and producing spoken audio of written text (in chat).
- Providing Flip cards with Sign Language.
